## Technologies

- Spring Boot
- Vue.js
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

## Database - PostgreSQL
- The database operates on the port by default `5432`
- After starting pgAdmin, it is necessary to create a database named jpa
- Datasource username : postgres, password : root
- There is a data-postgres.sql script in the resources folder that runs automatically when you start a back-end project
- This is set in application.properties - spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create-drop

## Steps to take when starting a back-end project in an Eclipse development environment
- Import ISABackEnd project into workspace: Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Project
- Then install all the dependencies from the pom.xml file
- Finally, right-click on the project -> Run as -> Java Application / Spring Boot app (if the STS plugin from the Eclipse marketplace is installed)
- The back-end will be launched on port `8091`

## Steps to take when starting a front-end project in a Visual Studio Code environment
- You must install node.js
- Open your Visual Studio Code and import the ISAFrontEnd folder
- Open a terminal in the Visual Studio Code and then type the commands:
```sh
                                $ npm install
                                $ npm run serve
```
- The front-end will be launched on port `8080`
- If your port is busy, follow the instructions below:
- Run Cmd.exe ( Command Prompt ) as administrator
- Then type the commands:
```sh
                                $ netstat -ano | findstr :8080
                                $ taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
- Enter the number on which he is listening instead of <PID>
